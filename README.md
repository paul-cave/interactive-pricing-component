Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (very small application)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I didn't actually know there was a native html element for range sliders, so I ended up building the slider from scratch with JS. Definitely a valuable experience.

### Useful resources

- [Creating a pure lavascript range slider control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41068428/creating-a-pure-javascript-range-slider-control) - This stackoverflow solution gave me a great starting point for building my slider from scratch.
- [gav's blog: Find the closest number in an array JavaScript](https://www.gavsblog.com/blog/find-closest-number-in-array-javascript) - This article gave me a way to convert the range slider from a smooth/stepless slider into my desired number of increments and always have the slider button land on the closest value.
